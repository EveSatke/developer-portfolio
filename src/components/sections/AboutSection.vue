      I'm a <strong>former UX/UI designer turned web developer</strong>, currently learning
      front-end development at <strong>Turing College</strong>. My diverse experience across
      finance, agency work, and enterprise development enables me to understand both business
      requirements and user needs when creating digital solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My career began in finance at Danske Bank, but I quickly realized my calling was in creative,
      technology-driven work. After completing web design studies at Code Academy, I worked at
      <strong>Starflix digital agency</strong> creating WordPress sites for small and medium
      businesses. This experience taught me the fundamentals of web development and client
      communication, which inspired me to learn coding independently.

      After building my portfolio through self-study, I was selected as a
      <strong>software developer student at Danske Bank</strong> for a six-month program. This
      opportunity led to a <strong>hybrid developer-designer role</strong> where I worked with
      Angular applications for both web and mobile platforms. Eventually, my focus shifted entirely
      to UX/UI design as the role evolved.

      Following maternity leave, I recognized the shifting market demands toward research-focused
      design roles. Rather than limiting myself, I embraced the opportunity to return to my
      technical roots. I participated in the <strong>Woman Go Tech acceleration program</strong> for
      front-end development and am now pursuing front-end development education at Turing College,
      mastering <strong>Python, Vue, TypeScript, SQL, Git, and modern testing frameworks</strong>,
      while leveraging <strong>AI tools</strong> to accelerate my learning and development process.
    </p>
    <p>
      What drives me is the
      <strong>intersection of design thinking and technical implementation</strong>. I believe in
      creating applications that are not only visually appealing but also comfortable to use,
      balancing business requirements with user needs. My approach involves
      <strong>deep analysis, exploring multiple solutions, and making informed decisions</strong>
      that bring designs to life in the real world.
